                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Settings Optimization intern at Formlabs, working in a mixed lab + data focused test and development space. 
                    Workflow involves Git based source management, Python for json scripting and data analysis, SOP documentation, 
                    metrology for mechanical and optical properties.
                </p>
                <p>My work involves discussions around product development, shipping, and stakeholder meetings. Methodologies such as: Design for Manufacturing (DFM), Design for Test (DFT), Rapid Prototyping (RP)</p>
                <p>Director for UW-NanoRobotics Group, advancing additive manufacturing for flexible electronics. We also host an endorsed and accredited curriculum program with the Waterloo Institute of Nanotechnology (WIN) to reinforce engineering concepts through hands-on projects.</p>
                <h2>4 Fun</h2>
                <p>Climbing, and when I'm lucky kitesurfing are my favourite ways to spend time, I'm also a big fan of cooking and trying new recipes.</p>

                    <p>
                        In this project, I led a multidisciplinary team focused on the synthesis and optimization of conductive inks for additive manufacturing, 
                        specifically targeting silver nanoparticle formulations for flexible PCBs in wearable electronics. This ink could be used by the printer the mechanical team was designing (CHIP, pictured above).
                        My leadership responsibilities included setting project milestones, aligning team goals, and 
                        facilitating R&D, production, and quality assurance (QA). 
                        I established clear communication channels and coordinated the creation of technical documentation such as SOPs and BOMs to ensure knowledge transfer and process consistency. 
                        By mentoring junior researchers and fostering a collaborative lab environment, 
                        I helped drive innovation in ink formulation, deposition techniques, and performance testing, 
                        all while maintaining a strong focus on safety and reproducibility.

                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        My role was to develop a deposition process for MANTECH’s chemical oxygen demand (COD) biosensors. 
                        I wanted to achieve a uniform coating of the photoanode material on the substrate, increase yield, and improve adhesion (therby lifetime of the sensor).
                        My two main focuses were on the environmental factors affecting the deposition process (temperature, humidity) as well as the human error/variability observed bewtween batches.
                        I tuned the solution's surface tension to ensure it could be evenly deposited onto the substrate with the desired thickness and porosity. 
                        The initial results were promising but indicated room for improvement in yield and adhesion. 
                        To enhance the yield, I adjusted deposition parameters and implemented new quality assurance (QA) steps using data acquisition. 
                        The adhesion issues between batches were solved by employing a surface treatment normally used for silicon wafers in the Quantum Nano Fabrication and Characterization Facility (QNFCF) cleanroom. 
                        I then created comprehensive standard operating procedures (SOPs) and instructional videos to ensure the process could be consistently replicated for device production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        **I signed an NDA with MANTECH and am unable to share the exact details of the deposition process.**

                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        My role focused on developing laser-induced defect TiO₂ photoanodes for applications in solar energy conversion, 
                        organic pollutant oxidation (breaking down harmful chemicals), and wastewater sensing. 
                        Key objectives included achieving uniform defect engineering, preventing photoanode degradation, and ensuring reliable fabrication for industrial adoption. 
                        Using root cause analysis with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), 
                        I identified and mitigated degradation mechanisms in TiO₂, enabling stable performance.
                        I optimized spray-coating deposition parameters (e.g., material composition, pressure, and surface treatment) to control film quality, 
                        nanosecond-pulsed TiO₂ for Ti³⁺/oxygen vacancies, and femtosecond-pulsed TiO₂ for surface-localized Ti³⁺/oxygen vacancies. Batch-to-batch variability was addressed through Python-driven data analysis, which correlated process inputs with material properties. Standardized protocols were then developed to ensure reproducibility across academic and industrial settings.
